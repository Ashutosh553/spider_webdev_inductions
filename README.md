## About me
Hi! This is Ishani.I study at NIT Trichy. I am here to learn new things so I won't say that my hobby is coding but I have other interests.
I hope to make coding my hobby over the coming days.
### Interests
 * *Astronomy*-This is very close to me
  * painting
  * playing badminton
  * travelling to new places

PS-It will be the first one I am making so it might look awful but please suggest ways to improve it and I hope one day it will look fine :)
